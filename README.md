you can also customize the generated pattern by putting in the width and height you want the pattern to be (in format: WWxHH; e.g. 31x15), the desired color (which serves as a template for the random color) and the luminosity (e.g.: dark, light, bright).

Example you can put into the command line:

# node index.js 31x15 blue dark
